    <p>These stars are really getting large now. Aldebaran is believed to host a planet several times the mass of jupiter,. The “bull’s eye” is the brightest star in the constellation of taurus and the 13th brightest in the night sky. The chinese net asterism is formed by aldebaran with ain (epsilon tauri), prima hyadum (gamma tauri), secunda hyadum (delta1 tauri), delta3 tauri, chamukuy (theta1tauri), 71 tauri and lambda tauri. Its brightness varies from magnitude 0.75 to 0.95 according to historical records given in th. This star also was honored in the classic movie, ben hur, appearing as the name of one of the chariot horses. In addition, another interesting fact will have the american space probe (pioneer 10, heading for deep space) passing by this star in about two million years. Aldebaran also has its place in mythology. The star came within 21.5 light years of the solar system and, at its maximum, was slightly brighter than siriusis today (mag. Great energy and perseverance, high material honors but the danger of losing them, danger from quarrels and the law, honor, and riches ending in disgrace and ruin, liable to disease, fevers, and violent death. Aldebaran has a luminosity 518 times that of the sun (153 times in visible light). Also known as the winter circle, the asterism dominates the evening sky during the northern hemisphere winter, containing the winter triangle and most of the constellation orion within its borders. With a surface temperature of 3,900 k, it shines with a luminosity 439 times that of the sun, with a lot of its energy output being in the invisible infrared.</p>
    <p><u>Aldebaran is located in the zodiac constellation taurus. The star came within 21.5 light years of the solar system and, at its maximum, was slightly brighter than siriusis today (mag. If in conjunction with both sun and mars, great liability to pestilential fevers. Based on its findings, a hypothetical planet orbiting aldebaran would have a mass of at least 11.4 jupiter masses and orbit the star with a period of 643 days from a distance of 2 astronomical units. The name was officially approved by the international astronomical union’s (iau) working group on star names (wgsn) on june 30, 2016. See full list on osr.org</u></p>
